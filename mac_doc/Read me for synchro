Some information about synchro	Turn it on by setting CPU speed to -1 (negative one).	To achieve best sound...	If you use CPU-heavy game or too cool demo,  you know you need a G3, don't you... for  MOD players and Pushover style games,  or for FrameRate>4 slower CPU's will do..	Remember, synchro works only when  your Mac is faster than Amiga 500...  Because emulation speed is not a constant,  sound can choke when your CPU gets too slow;  this happens:     - on some hard-to-emulate parts     - disk access (especially .adz files)     - VM swap gets active (happens rarely)     - You did not hit command-M for mouse..        (Amiga has to have full control,         otherwise it'll get too slow or choked         by Finder events).			- You insert a disk (this way you create         a time delay which confuses synchro)   When sound chokes, it lasts from   1 to 10 seconds approximately, and   then it returns to normal..    (This is due to error accumulation and    strange half-way fuzzy stupid code I wrote)	I recommend that you set your framerate to 2 or 3,  that way it should work...   If your game   is not doing a lot of loading, your SFX   and music should be fine..   This synchro system has been tested on G3/240 (iMac), on:   demos:   Misery Dentro II   Arte by Sanity   9 Fingers (Spaceballs) [chokes a few times bkoz of lots of disk access]   3D Demo II intro by Anarchy   3D Demo II by Anarchy   Extension by Pygmy Projects   Odyssey by Alcatraz Prods.
